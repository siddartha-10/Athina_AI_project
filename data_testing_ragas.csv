The bar graphs with 95% CI error bars for all numerical\nvariables stratified by IDA status were generated using matplotlib software, and the 95%\nCIs were non-overlapping and hence considered statistically significant ( p< 0.05 ).

What influenced the IDA prediction model and how did ferritin and CBC data impact its efficiency?,"['BioMedInformatics 2024 ,4 669\nprediction of IDA based on CBC data (Supplementary Table S1). However, nearly all studies\nthat specifically focused on IDA classification included serum iron or ferritin parameters\nin addition to CBC data for the prediction of IDA. One study predicted low ferritin (IDA)\nbut only for data from adult anemic subjects (above 18 years old) generated from the\nreferred lab tests. However, a model that applies to all age groups, including pregnant\nwomen, is lacking, possibly due to the extensive requirement of high-quality and paired\nCBC and serum ferritin data for the classification of IDA along with information on age, sex,\nand pregnancy status. Fortunately, these data are available in NHANES surveys, which\nprovides an opportunity to test and classify IDA based on CBC variables.\nIn this study, we created a subset of data (n = 19,975) with paired demography, CBC,\nand serum ferritin values, and categorized the IDA based on their age and gender-specific\nhemoglobin and serum ferritin. In this dataset, we found that the proportion of subjects with\nIDA (5%) is close to half that with anemia (8.6%). Further, a higher proportion of anemia\nand IDA was in females compared to males, and the proportion of IDA among females also\nincreased with age, which are consistent with reported age and gender differences in the\nprevalence of anemia and IDA [2].\nSince there is severe class imbalance in the data, average precision (PR AUC) is\nconsidered the best performance metric in assessing model performance [ 37]. In our\nanalysis, the Gradient Boost algorithm performed best and was chosen for the further\noptimization that included feature selection and class imbalance handling through random\noversampling. Further, to test for differences if any, feature selection was performed without\nand with random oversampling using the RFECV algorithm, and the model performance\nwas assessed with these selected features. The selected best features were the same with or\nwithout random oversampling, except that an additional variable was selected with the\nlatter. However, random oversampling resulted in a marked increase in recall (sensitivity)\nfor positive classes. Discussion with a domain expert suggested that it is important to have\nhigher sensitivity for guiding treatment, and treating those without IDA or potentially\nborderline cases is unlikely to have large negative health impacts. The selected features such\nas age (RIDAGEYR), sex (RIAGENDR), and pregnancy status (RIDEXPRG) are expected as\nthe reference values of hemoglobin and serum ferritin to classify anemia which is specific\nto these groups [ 1,5,33]. The other features related to hemoglobin and RBC morphology\n(LBXHGB, LBXHCT, LBXMCVSI, LBXMCHSI, LBXRDW) are also expected based on prior\nknowledge [ 9]. However, two additional WBC features, lymphocytes (LBDLYMNO) and\nmonocytes (LBDMONO), which were not expected, also appear to contribute to the model‚Äôs\nperformance. Serum ferritin is acute phase protein, and inflammation elevates its levels\nindependent of body iron stores [ 5,39]. Therefore, serum ferritin values are corrected\nfor inflammation with the use of additional markers of inflammation such as C-reactive\nprotein (CRP), prior to using it for assessing ID or IDA [ 39]. Since several WBC variables\nincluding lymphocyte and monocyte levels are elevated during inflammation [ 40], this\nexplains their contribution to the model. Indeed, the lymphocyte count is (2.65 (95% CI\n2.64‚Äì2.67) vs. 2.24 (95% CI 2.19‚Äì2.30)) and monocyte count is (0.57 (95% CI 0.56‚Äì574) vs.\n0.55 (95% CI 0.54‚Äì0.56)). In addition, we also found that the importance of RIAGENDR\n(gender) was less when the model was trained with random oversampling. However, this\ndifference could simply be due to oversampling of the data for this gender, with a higher\nproportion of positive IDA cases. Interestingly, when tested with unseen data originating\nfrom completely different settings, the trained model also performed exceptionally well,\nindicating its great utility across different datasets and/or geographics, and is stable to the\nsubtle analytical differences across labs, if any.\nExplaining disease diagnosis by showing the specific contributions of individual\nfeatures to such prediction is of great importance to allow the clinician to make informed\ndecisions.

"What could be the benefits and impacts of clinical trials for the IDA-detecting ML model, given its CBC data reliance and varied performance?","['BioMedInformatics 2024 ,4 670\nolder age (RIDAGEYR), higher RDW (LBXRDW), being female and pregnant, and having\nlower values of MCH, MCV , HCT, lymphocytes, and monocytes contribute to the prediction\nof IDA class, with relative importances. While all these variable contributions are consistent\nwith the known literature [ 6‚Äì8,27,28] the contribution of lower lymphocytes and monocytes\nto IDA could be mediated by the effect of inflammation on serum ferritin levels [5,39,41].\nThe published ML models for anemia classification all use different data than used\nhere or perform a task other than discriminating IDA. For example, they rely on image data,\nor they use CBC variables to identify genetic disorders related to hemoglobin [ 10‚Äì20,27‚Äì30].\nSince the cause of anemia is multifactorial [ 4], identifying concurrent iron deficiency is\nrequired to guide iron therapy. Our developed ML model is unique in identifying the\npresence of IDA based on CBC data alone, eliminating the need for an additional serum\nferritin test. The diagnosis of IDA using our model has two important benefits. First,\nin a clinical setting, the model helps in making an informed decision to treat using iron\nsupplementation. Second, in a public health survey setting, the model helps in quantifying\nthe proportion of IDA, which contributes to understanding the factors associated with\nanemia, which is key information required for formulating appropriate actions.\n5. Limitations and Future Directions\nOne limitation of our study is the serious class imbalance, which is typical of the\ndisorder, although this imbalance can be overcome by using random over sampling, with\nminimal impact on the role of individual features. The other limitation is that we did not\ncorrect serum ferritin levels for inflammation prior to using it as a classifier of IDA, but we\nbelieve that this can partly be negated by CBC data on WBC indicators (lymphocytes and\nmonocytes) which can be surrogate markers of inflammation. For example, WBC count has\nbeen shown to positively correlate with CRP levels [ 35], and future studies that compare\nthe adjustment of serum ferritin using WBC indices with that of CRP corrected values\nmerits investigation.\nWe also acknowledge that testing the model‚Äôs performance in a real clinical setting\nwould be beneficial, but this is beyond the scope of the study. However, performing a\nclinical trial could be a logistical extension of this ML model, where it might be directly\nintegrated into the CBC analyzer itself with the results validated via serum ferritin tests\n(reverse of what is performed now). Since conducting such a trial would be costly, evidence\nsuch as this data study would likely be needed to justify it, and this testing would most\nlikely be carried out by blood analysis device manufacturers.\n6. Conclusions\nOur study successfully developed a machine learning model that discriminates IDA\nfrom other forms of anemia, solely based on CBC data with particularly high recall for IDA\npositive cases. The study used two publicly available datasets (a NHANES dataset of more\nthan 19,000 instances from the US and a smaller dataset from Kenya) and found that IDA\ncan be classified from CBC data with a PR AUC of 0.87 and recall/sensitivity of 0.98 and 0.89\nfor the original dataset and the unseen one collected in Kenya, respectively. In the analysis\nof feature importance, we found that a low blood level of hemoglobin (LBXHGB), older age\n(RIDAGEYR), higher RDW (LBXRDW), being female and pregnant, and lower values of\nMCH, MCV , HCT, lymphocytes, and monocytes contributed most to the prediction of IDA\nclass. The precision, recall, and generalizability of the model to unseen data and the role of\nfeatures associated with the predictions align well with known prior knowledge, which\nstrongly supports the confidence in providers making informed decisions on whether to\ntreat with iron or advise additional testing. It would also be useful in public health survey\nsettings to quantify the proportion of iron deficiency associated with anemia, without\nadditional testing. In the future, following appropriate clinical trials, it would be possible\nto integrate this model directly into CBC analyzer platforms to provide diagnostic decision\nsupport along with CBC reporting, which should encourage the development of enhanced\nCBC platforms.']","Clinical trials for the IDA-detecting ML model could provide valuable testing of the model‚Äôs performance in a real clinical setting.

These files were transferred to a Jupiter notebook and combined using the pandas library. The data was then preprocessed by concatenating all files of demography, CBC, and serum ferritin, and merging each file based on SEQUENCE IDs into a single data frame. This aligned the paired data of survey subjects across all variables. The results were then converted into a .csv file for further analysis. Variable selection and data cleaning involved removing all demographic variables except subject ID, age, gender, and pregnancy data. Variables LBXLYPCT, LBXMOPCT, LBXNEPCT, LBXEOPCT, LBXBAPCT were also removed as their absolute counts were available in other variables. Rows where LBXHGB or LBXFER is null were also removed, as both these features are necessary for IDA classification. Any row with ferritin values of 150 ¬µg/L for females, 200¬µg/L for males, which indicates iron overload, and any row with null values in any of the variables was removed.

Complete Blood Count (CBC) tests are less costly and more\nwidely available. Machine learning models have not yet been applied to discriminating IDA but do\nwell for similar tasks. Methods: We constructed multiple machine learning methods to classify IDA\nfrom CBC data using a US NHANES dataset of over 19,000 instances, calculating accuracy, precision,\nrecall, and precision AUC (PR AUC). We validated the results using an unseen dataset from Kenya,\nusing the same model. We calculated ranked feature importance to explain the global behavior of the\nmodel. Results: Our model classifies IDA with a PR AUC of 0.87 and recall/sensitivity of 0.98 and\n0.89 for the original dataset and an unseen Kenya dataset, respectively. The explanations indicate\nthat low blood level of hemoglobin, higher age, and higher Red Blood Cell distribution width were\nmost critical. We also found that optimization made only minor changes to the explanations and\nthat the features used remained consistent with professional practice. Conclusions: The overall high\nperformance and consistency of the results suggest that the approach would be acceptable to health\nprofessionals and would support enhancements to current automated CBC analyzers.\nKeywords: explainable AI; biomedical data; blood disorders; anemia; ferritin; iron deficiency; iron\ndeficiency anemia; machine learning; SHAP\n1. Introduction\nIt is currently unknown how well data from routine Complete Blood Count (CBC)\ntests alone can be used to identify a common form of anemia (iron deficiency), potentially\nreplacing a more expensive test (serum ferritin) now used by experts for diagnosis. Here, we\naddress this question through a novel application of Machine Learning methods involving\nmodel training and feature selection. We then apply methods for explaining the output\nof Machine Learning models to reveal which aspects of the CBC results contribute most\nto a diagnosis and to what extent methods meant to improve model performance impact\nthe role of different features. These additional tests allow us to confirm that the machine\nlearning model‚Äôs ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù is consistent with clinical judgment. This use of explanatory\nAI to show the impact of feature selection on feature importance is also unique to this study.\nAnemia, defined by blood hemoglobin levels lower than specific age and gender\nreference levels [ 1], is of global health concern affecting the health and productivity of pop-\nulations [ 2]. The 2023 Global Burden of Disease study estimated that the global prevalence\nof anemia is about 24.5%, corresponding to about 1.98 billion people [ 2]. Iron deficiency\nis a common, yet potentially preventable, cause of anemia because iron is an essential\nnutrient for both the synthesis and functioning of hemoglobin [ 3]. Insufficient consump-\ntion or malabsorption of dietary iron results in the reduced synthesis of red blood cells\nand blood hemoglobin levels [ 1]. Thus, supplementation of iron is routinely practiced,\nimproving blood hemoglobin levels in populations where the prevalence of anemia is more\nthan 40% [ 1]. Although the most common cause of anemia has been iron deficiency, the\nBioMedInformatics 2024 ,4, 661‚Äì673. https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedinformatics4010036 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomedinformatics']","Machine learning models are constructed to classify Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA) from Complete Blood Count (CBC) data.
